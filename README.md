# NinjabrainBot Launcher
An executable that runs any NinjabrainBot jar file found in the same folder. It allows running as admin and pinning to the Start menu.

Download the executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/qMaxXen/NinjabrainBot-Launcher/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section.

## Usage

Place the executable in the same folder as your NinjabrainBot jar file and run it. It will automatically launch the JAR file.
