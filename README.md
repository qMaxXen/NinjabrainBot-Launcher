# NinjabrainBot Launcher
An executable that runs any `Ninjabrain.jar` file found in the same folder. It allows running as admin and pinning to the Start menu.

Download the executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/qMaxXen/NinjabrainBot-Launcher/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section.

## Usage

Place the executable in the same folder as your `Ninjabrain.jar` file and run it. It will automatically launch the JAR file.

## Credits

Thanks to [@Montage](https://github.com/m-ont) for compiling the script into an executable.
